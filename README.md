Solasta multiclass builder how to use:

You can alter the custom classes that are generated by the builder by altering the "CustomMulticlassCombox.txt".
There are some examples already in there such as:
Class=Fighter,Subclass=MartialMountaineer,Levels=1;Class=Wizard,Subclass=TraditionShockArcanist,Levels=9;
Class=Ranger,Subclass=RangerHunter,Levels=5;Class=Rogue,Subclass=RoguishDarkweaver,Levels=3;Class=Ranger,Subclass=RangerHunter,Levels=2;

AS you can see, you need to specify the class, subclass and how many levels of that class.
You can take levels of a class multiple times as seen in the Ranger example.
Unfortunately this builder is still a work in progress.  
Multiple spellcasting classes do not combine properly, you will only get the spellcasting feature from the first class that gets their spellcasting.
Your spell slots will still properly go up based on caster level from the 5e rules though.
Some other features that are based on character level also don't currently work properly (Paladin Lay On Hands healing pool goes up on non-Paladin levels as an example)

Have fun trying out multi-classes below are the class names and subclass names that should work.
Also as a fun note with the way I wrote the builder technically the subclass doesn't care what 'parent' class it's from so you can try wacky combos like 
Class=Fighter,Subclass=DomainElementalCold,Levels=5;Class=Rogue,Subclass=RangerHunter,Levels=5;
